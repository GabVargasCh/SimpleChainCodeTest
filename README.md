# Simple ChainCode Test

Chaincode Test is done using Mocha and [WeAreTheLedger Mock Stub](https://github.com/wearetheledger/fabric-mock-stub)


## Usage

```bash
npm run build
npm run test
```

For every consecutive test, just run

```bash
npm run test
```

Module is compiled with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links) so make sure you are able to use it.

```bash
tsc --version
```

Should throw something similar to

```bash
Version 3.5.2
```
